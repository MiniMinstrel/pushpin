## ðŸ“Œ What is PushPin?
<p>PushPin is the digital solution for teacher and club organizers. Instead of using
a cluttered and unreliable physical bulletin board, PushPin digitalizes the process
and provides streamline access to information for students. Students and faculty will
be able to post and search up information with just the push of a button.</p> 

<p>Created for UF's CEN3031 final project, the goal is to help students and teachers disseminate  information quickly and efficiently. In addition to that, other organizations  can use it to allow students to stay up to date with events happening around UF's campus</p>
